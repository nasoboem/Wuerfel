Hi,
this is a package for students of the programming language Go that implements dices and their placeholders with different amount of faces.
Dices in of them selves are just random number pickers and as long one doesn't want to draw the dices any number of faces work. However,
there are dices implemented with 2,4,6,8,12,20 sided dice.
In the test file one can test all the dice. They initialize without a value. By clicking on them one can roll the dice. By clicking on the corresponding
placeholder the dice is moving to the placeholder.

If you have any questions you can send me an e-mail.
Have fun!!
